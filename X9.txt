X9: Game Manager

This folder contains two versions of a "moth" program. They
are functionally equivalent. The first version is moth1.htm
and moth2.js. The second version is moth2.htm, game.htm, and
moth2.js. (moth1.js can be substituted for moth2.js.)

game.htm contains the "game manager". This governs the game's
response to events like user actions and the Ticker 'tick'.
The game manager is notified when these events occur. It can
then use the current game state to decide what the response
should be.

What to do: (20 pts)

Suppose the first version was written by a newbie programmer.
Develop step-by-step instructions that will enable this newbie
to create the second version. For each step, explain why that
step is necessary. Strive for a balance between detail and
generality. Too much detail makes the job "mindless" and the
newbie won't learn anything. Too much generality and the
newbie may not be able to figure out what to do or how to do
it.

Bonus: (1 pt)

Impress the newbie with your programming skills by extending
the second version to simulate any number of moths.
